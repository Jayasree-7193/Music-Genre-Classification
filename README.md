# Music-Genre-Classification


Abstract


In this project we adapt the model from Choi et al. to train a custom music genre classification system with our own genres and data. The model takes as an input the spectogram of music frames and analyzes the image using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) plus a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The output of the system is a vector of predicted genres for the song.

We fine-tuned their model with a small dataset (30 songs per genre) and test it on the GTZAN dataset providing a final accuracy of 80%.
